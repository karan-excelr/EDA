Pandas is an open-source Python library that provides high-performance, easy-to-use data structures, and data analysis tools. It is widely used in data science, machine learning, and data analysis tasks for its powerful data manipulation and processing capabilities. With Pandas, users can work with data in a tabular format, similar to a spreadsheet, but with more functionality and efficiency.
